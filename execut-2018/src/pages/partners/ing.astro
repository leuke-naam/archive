      <h1>About ING</h1>

      <p>
        Not many traditional industries are impacted by the current Technology
        Disruption like Banking. As a front-runner in providing Financial
        Services to over 37 million customers in 40 different countries, ING is
        fully geared up to drive that change. Traditional geographic borders
        disappear, FinTechs challenge the establishment, real-time is what our
        customers expect, and trust and security is not an added value but
        merely the foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The banking industry is increasingly becoming an IT-driven enterprise.
        The ING Think Forward strategy provides a unified customer experience to
        all clients, independent of time and place. ING is uniting across
        borders and is rapidly changing long-established processes and
        procedures to become truly digital. We do not follow innovations around
        us, but initiate them. To support these changes, ING has globally
        adopted the Agile Way-of-Working: management no longer steers and
        decides, but our (IT) Engineers drive the change, while management
        facilitates. We feel that only then ING will be able to stand the
        challenges of the time ahead — and we do not only preach this, but
        practice it every minute of the day.
