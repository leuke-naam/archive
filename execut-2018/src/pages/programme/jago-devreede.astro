      <h1 id="abstract">Digitizing your old 8mm films with a PI</h1>

      <p>
        Until the late 80's consumers used film like super 8 to record their own films, but not a lot of equipment survived to play them back or people don't want to setup a projector and screen for a few minutes of movie. There are a lot of companies that can scan your movie and put it on a hard disk or DVD. But how hard can it be to do it yourself?
      </p>

      <p>
        After this talk you will know what it takes to digitize your own films code-wise and how to build a rig to facilitate this.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some topics that will be touched upon: using a scanner with a PI, image processing (on a PI), resource management, lessons learned.
