As the `(ut)` in `exec(ut)` suggests the conference will be hosted in Utrecht. The venue of the event will be Media Plaza in the renowned Jaarbeurs, which is located a stone's throw away from Utrecht Central Station. Both the large Auditorium and barzone will be at our disposal throughout the day.

The Auditorium is colloquially known as "The Rainbow", for its comfortable, colourful seats. Of course you will have ample time to verify this sales-pitch throughout the day.
