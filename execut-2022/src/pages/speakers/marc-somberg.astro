      <p><strong>Augmented Intelligence, extending the reach of Healthcare professionals by using AI</strong></p>

      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is one of the most hyped and misunderstood technologies in the healthcare industry. What are the reasons that AI is not already broadly implemented in hospitals and clinics? What does it take to bring a machine learning model from theory to practice?
      </p>

      <p>
        I will answer these questions, share some of my experiences in working with some of the leading AI and medical specialists, and perhaps use some unnecessary pictures of giant robots and people staring at equations.
