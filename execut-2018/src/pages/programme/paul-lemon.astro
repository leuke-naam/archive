        Gracenote Sports are a global sports data provider supplying rich data covering schedules, results, live scores, and historical data across more than 220 sports internationally. This talk will cover the challenge of delivering this service for the Winter Olympics 2018 for a range of international broadcasters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gracenote covered all 200+ events in the Winter Olympics, powering data for 40 customers on their websites, mobile applications, and TV screens in 24 languages — reaching millions of users across the globe.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were many technical challenges to deliver the data accurately at sub-second speeds from the Olympic venues to these destinations. Gracenote used a wide range of technologies including Kafka, React, Kubernetes, and AWS, and we'll explain how they helped us deliver Gracenote's biggest-ever Olympics.
