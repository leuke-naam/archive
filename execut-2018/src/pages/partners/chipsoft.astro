      <h1>About ChipSoft</h1>

      <p>
        Putting muscle into it and developing the best healthcare software. With
        that team spirit, Hans and Gerrit Mulder started ChipSoft in 1986. This
        no-nonsense mentality is still at the core of the company three decades
        later. More than ever, because the Mulders acquired over 650 "Chippies"
        along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        All those hundreds of employees get opportunities to develop themselves
        further through training and education — and to work on their own ideas.
        At ChipSoft, we believe in the Dutch motto "beter goed bedacht, dan goed
        gejat." This freedom also holds true for activities with your
        colleagues.

        What is outright ChipSoft? Getting a medical specialist up to speed on
        the precisions of our software, organising a sports activity for your
        colleagues, or developing a solution that optimises patient logistics in
        hospitals. All of this with one common purpose: solidifying our lead
        position in the world of health IT. Are you in?
