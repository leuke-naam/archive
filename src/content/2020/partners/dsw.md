At DSW we prefer to create our own software applications. We hardly ever use ready-made programs. Our systems for processing healthcare expenses claims, for the registration of new clients or for robotics: our own people designed, developed and tested each and every one of these. Are you interested in development, but still lacking the skills? No problem! We have our own training programs for C# and SQL to make sure you can quickly become a full-fledged member of our teams for developing applications. Building our own chatbot Nikkie or integrating IDEAL in our app, to make it easier for the insured to pay their bills? Our developers consider it a piece of cake!

Want to know more? Check out ictbijDSW.nl for a more complete presentation of what working at DSW can be like. However, we prefer getting to know you during exec(ut). We hope to see you there!
