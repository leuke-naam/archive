      <h1 id="abstract">Big data to big impact: redefining chronic disease with real-world evidence</h1>

      <p>
        The Low Carb Program is a behaviour change platform for people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and obesity that is redefining metabolic health. Peer-reviewed, published outcomes demonstrate that the Low Carb Program is more effective than first-line medication for type 2 diabetes - and what's more, it places the condition into remission for 26% of patients at 1-year. Localized in three markets, the platform is incentivizing wellness and providing hope to over 380,000 patients through insurance companies, health agencies and National Health Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        The talk will explore how the Low Carb Program is augmenting traditional healthcare - and the concerns, intertias, ethics and considerations encountered as DDM develop a new form of medication - digital therapeutics; and how real-world evidence is rewriting the clinical textbooks.
