      <p>
        If you thrive in an environment where you are propelled to new limits every day, then Optiver is the place for you. So, what is it that we do and why does it lie at the cutting-edge of technology, trading and research?

      <h3>A never-ending pursuit of excellence.</h3>

      <p>
        We are market makers. In simple terms, we provide bid-ask prices for financial products in exchanges all over the world. This creates the liquidity needed to keep the markets viable and allow everyone to trade at will. In essence, we improve the market and give it stability even in times of extreme volatility. It's a responsibility we don't take lightly but that also makes what we do so exciting.
