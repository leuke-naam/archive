We’re about to experience major changes. We’ll soon drive around smart cities in autonomous cars that just came out of a 3D printer. We’ll reach the age of 300 and perhaps even become immortal. If we have to leave the earth in 500 years, will Mars be an alternative? Many jobs will no longer exist in the world of tomorrow. How will we ensure that people live fulfilling lives? What type of education and which skills will we need to create tomorrow's world together? New possibilities and business models are emerging. Organizations need to be prepared for the future.
