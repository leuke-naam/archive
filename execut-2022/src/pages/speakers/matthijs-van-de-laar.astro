      <p><strong>Storytelling in an Autonomous Game World</strong></p>

      <p>
        Among the many challenges of creating their 3D open world action adventure debut title Pine (2019), Matthijs tells you all about telling stories in a digitally simulated ecology. How do you connect to characters and a storyline, while the actors for that story might not even exist? How do you guide players through a world that is constantly changing? Through a deep dive into the narrative and system design of 'Pine', this talk provides insights into a key aspect of games that's getting better as the medium develops.
