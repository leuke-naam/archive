Putting muscle into it and developing the best healthcare software. With that team spirit, Hans and Gerrit Mulder started ChipSoft in 1986. This no-nonsense mentality is still at the core of the company three decades later. More than ever, because the Mulders acquired over 650 "Chippies" along the way.

All those hundreds of employees get opportunities to develop themselves further through training and education — and to work on their own ideas. At ChipSoft, we believe in the Dutch motto "beter goed bedacht, dan goed gejat." This freedom also holds true for activities with your colleagues.

What is outright ChipSoft? Getting a medical specialist up to speed on the precisions of our software, organising a sports activity for your colleagues, or developing a solution that optimises patient logistics in hospitals. All of this with one common purpose: solidifying our lead position in the world of health IT. Are you in?
