      <p>
        In his talk on 'Priming &amp; Persuasive Technology' Mischa will share some key methodologies and psychological tactics on how to influence and persuade customers and users to behave in the way you would like them to. This means using technology-based insights and technology-delivered messaging to persuade users to buy, behave healthily, share your proposition, or perform any other desired target behaviour.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mischa will go into the psychology of unconscious choice and decision-making and explain a number of key tactics to use in your design and development. These tactics are all science- and evidence-based strategies from the field of social and media psychology.
