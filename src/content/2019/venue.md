As the `(ut)` in `exec(ut)` suggests the conference is to be hosted in Utrecht. The venue of the event will be the renowned TivoliVredenburg, which is located a stone's throw away from Utrecht Central Station. Both Hertz and Plein6, the networking area/barzone, will be at our disposal throughout the day.

Hertz is built for listening to everything worthwhile, whether it's classical concerts or conference talks. Of course you will have ample time to test the seats and verify our sales-pitch throughout the day.
